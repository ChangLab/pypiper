Where to find pipelines
=========================

Independent pypiper pipelines are built by many authors at various locations.
There's no comprehensive list of all available pipelines, but here's a list of
some publicly available pipelines that will give you examples of production-ready pipelines built using pypiper.

* https://github.com/epigen/open_pipelines - A collection of pipelines to process diverse sequencing data types, including ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, and others.
* https://github.com/databio/rnapipe - A set of pipelines specifically for processing RNA.
* https://github.com/databio/dnameth_pipelines - Pipelines for Whole Genome and Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS and RRBS).
