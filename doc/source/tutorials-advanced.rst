Advanced tutorial
********************************************************************************

Here we have a more advanced bioinformatics pipeline that adds some new concepts. Download `count_reads.py <https://github.com/epigen/pypiper/blob/master/example_pipelines/count_reads.py>`_ and run it with `python count_reads.py` (or, better yet, make it executable (`chmod 755 count_reads.py`) and then run it directly with `./count_reads.py`). This example is a documented vignette; so just read it and run it to get an idea of how things work.
